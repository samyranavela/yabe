  Ghost has a single, powerful organisational taxonomy, called tags.

  It doesn't matter whether you want to call them categories, tags, boxes, or
  anything else. You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging
  posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of
  related content.

  Basic tagging
  When you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between
  categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with News  and
  other posts with Cycling, which would create two distinct categories of content
  listed on /tag/news/  and /tag/cycling/, respectively.

  If you tag a post with both News  and  Cycling  - then it appears in both
  sections.

  Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you
  have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own
  cover images and meta data.

  The primary tag
  Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The
  first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will
  only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can
  add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add
  a bunch of related tags which are less important.

  News, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports

  In this example, News  is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme,
  but the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their
  respective archives.

  Private tags
  Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't
  necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In
  Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.

  For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want
  your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more
  space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use
  private tags to tell your theme what to do.

  News, Cycling, #video

  Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News, and
  Cycling  - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with
   #video.

  In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them
  special formatting:

  {{#post}}
      {{#has tag="#video"}}
          ...markup for a nice big video post layout...
      {{else}}
          ...regular markup for a post...
      {{/has}}
  {{/post}}
