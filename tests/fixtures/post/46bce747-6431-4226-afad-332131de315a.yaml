  Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team

  Authors
  The base user level in Ghost is an author. Authors can write posts, edit their
  own posts, and publish their own posts. Authors are trusted  users. If you don't
  trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, you shouldn't invite them
  to Ghost admin.

  Editors
  Editors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an
  Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well
  as their own. Editors can also invite new authors to the site.

  Administrators
  The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do
  everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site
  settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full
  access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.

  The Owner
  There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which
  has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The
  Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access
  to additional special settings if applicable — for example, billing details, if
  using Ghost(Pro).

  It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles,
  including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for
  posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their
  design.
