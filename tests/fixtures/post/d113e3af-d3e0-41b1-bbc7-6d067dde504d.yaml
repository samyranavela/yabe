  There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Ghost editor

  If you've gotten pretty comfortable with all the basics [/the-editor/]  of
  writing in Ghost, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of
  things you can do with Markdown!

  As with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this
  post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.

  Special formatting
  As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in
  Markdown when the need arises, for example:

   * strike through
   * highlight
   * *escaped characters*

  Writing code blocks
  There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the
  first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping
  any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be
  displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

  .my-link {
      text-decoration: underline;
  }


  If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using
  Prism.js [http://prismjs.com/].

  Full bleed images
  One neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different
  types of images is to add a #hash  value to the end of the source URL, and then
  target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:



  which is styled with...

  img[src$="#full"] {
      max-width: 100vw;
  }


  This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their
  usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these
  types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you
  want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.

  Reference lists
  The quick brown fox [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox], jumped over the lazy
  dog [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog].

  Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want
  to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style.
  All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full
  separation between content and its source or reference.

  Creating footnotes
  The quick brown fox[1]  jumped over the lazy dog[2].

  Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate.
  Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.

  Full HTML
  Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown.
  You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML
  usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:


  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1. Foxes are red ↩︎


   2. Dogs are usually not red ↩︎
