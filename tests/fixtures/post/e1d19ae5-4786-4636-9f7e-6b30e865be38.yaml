  Ghost uses a language called Markdown  to format text.

  When you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined
  between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with
  the words in your document. The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can
  quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.

  At the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options
  to help you get started as easily as possible. You'll also notice that there's a
   ?  icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.

  For now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make
  sure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used.

  Formatting text
  The most common shortcuts are of course, bold  text, italic  text, and
  hyperlinks [https://example.com]. These generally make up the bulk of any
  document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard
  shortcuts.

   * CMD/Ctrl + B  for Bold
   * CMD/Ctrl + I  for Italic
   * CMD/Ctrl + K  for a Link
   * CMD/Ctrl + H  for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)

  With just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way
  to creating a beautifully formatted story.

  Inserting images
  Images in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an
  exclamation mark, like this:

  ![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)



  Most Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can
  click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can
  just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both
  will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.

  Important Note:  Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's
  always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files before
  uploading them to Ghost.

  Making lists
  Lists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an
  absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation.
  For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use *  or
   -  or +. Like this:

   1. Crack the eggs over a bowl
   2. Whisk them together
   3. Make an omelette

  or

   * Remember to buy milk
   * Feed the cat
   * Come up with idea for next story

  Adding quotes
  When you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece,
  you can use >  at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You
  might've seen this formatting before in email clients.

  A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand
  the most important points being made

  All themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look
  better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of
  text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes
  sparingly.

  Dividing things up
  If you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a
  couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just
  what you need. Dropping ---  on a new line will create a sleek divider, anywhere
  you want it.
