      Creating a totally custom design for your publication

      Ghost comes with a beautiful default theme called Casper, which is designed to
      be a clean, readable publication layout and can be easily adapted for most
      purposes. However, Ghost can also be completely themed to suit your needs.
      Rather than just giving you a few basic settings which act as a poor proxy for
      code, we just let you write code.

      There are a huge range of both free and premium pre-built themes which you can
      get from the Ghost Theme Marketplace [http://marketplace.ghost.org], or you can
      simply create your own from scratch.

        [http://marketplace.ghost.org]

      Anyone can write a completely custom Ghost theme, with just some solid knowledge
      of HTML and CSS

      Ghost themes are written with a templating language called handlebars, which has
      a bunch of dynamic helpers to insert your data into template files. Like
      {{author.name}}, for example, outputs the name of the current author.

      The best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at
      the
      source code for Casper [https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper], which is heavily
      commented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.

       * default.hbs  is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this
         file unless specifically told to use a different template.
       * post.hbs  is the file used in the context of viewing a post.
       * index.hbs  is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.
       * and so on

      We've got full and extensive theme documentation
      [http://themes.ghost.org/docs/about]  which outlines every template file,
      context and helper that you can use.

      If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or
      help, there's also a #themes  channel in our public Slack community
      [https://slack.ghost.org]  which we always recommend joining!

      Hey! Welcome to Ghost, it's great to have you :)

      We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site
      with some initial Getting Started  posts that will help you get familiar with
      everything in no time. This is the first one!

      There are a few things that you should know up-front:
       1. Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to
          actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best
          for. If you're using Ghost for some other purpose, that's fine too - but it
          might not be the best choice for you.


       2. The entire platform can be modified and customized to suit your needs, which
          is very powerful, but doing so does  require some knowledge of code. Ghost
          is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a
          simple personal blog.


       3. For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App
          [https://ghost.org/downloads/]  for your computer, which is the best way to
          access your Ghost site on a desktop device.



      Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost
      Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our Ghost(Pro)
      [https://ghost.org/pricing]  service, and every penny we make is re-invested
      into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern
      journalism.

      The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: the Ghost editor
      [/the-editor/].

      Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default Ghost  user from
      your team to remove all of these introductory posts!

Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:\n\n```\n.my-link {\n    text-decoration: underline;\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/).\n\n\n## Full bleed images\n\nOne neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a `#hash` value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:\n\n![walking](https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full)\n\nwhich is styled with...\n\n```\nimg[src$=\"#full\"] {\n    max-width: 100vw;\n}\n```\n\nThis creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.\n\n\n## Reference lists\n\n**The quick brown [fox][1], jumped over the lazy [dog][2].**\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox \"Wikipedia: Fox\"\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog \"Wikipedia: Dog\"\n\nAnother way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.\n\n\n## Creating footnotes\n\nThe quick brown fox[^1] jumped over the lazy dog[^2].\n\n[^1]: Foxes are red\n[^2]: Dogs are usually not red\n\nFootnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.\n\n\n## Full HTML\n\nPerhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n"}]],"sections":[[10,0]]}

      <p>As with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.</p>

      <p><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full" alt="walking"></p>
      <p>which is styled with...</p>
      <pre><code>img[src$=&quot;#full&quot;] {
          max-width: 100vw;
      }
      </code></pre>
      <p>This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.</p>

      <p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>

      <p>Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.</p>

      There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Ghost editor

      If you've gotten pretty comfortable with all the basics [/the-editor/]  of
      writing in Ghost, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of
      things you can do with Markdown!

      As with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this
      post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.

      Special formatting
      As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in
      Markdown when the need arises, for example:

       * strike through
       * highlight
       * *escaped characters*

      Writing code blocks
      There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the
      first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping
      any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be
      displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:

      .my-link {
          text-decoration: underline;
      }


      If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using
      Prism.js [http://prismjs.com/].

      Full bleed images
      One neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different
      types of images is to add a #hash  value to the end of the source URL, and then
      target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:



      which is styled with...

      img[src$="#full"] {
          max-width: 100vw;
      }


      This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their
      usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these
      types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you
      want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.

      Reference lists
      The quick brown fox [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox], jumped over the lazy
      dog [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog].

      Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want
      to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style.
      All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full
      separation between content and its source or reference.

      Creating footnotes
      The quick brown fox[1]  jumped over the lazy dog[2].

      Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate.
      Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.

      Full HTML
      Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown.
      You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML
      usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:


      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

       1. Foxes are red ↩︎


       2. Dogs are usually not red ↩︎

      Sometimes you might want to put your site behind closed doors

      If you've got a publication that you don't want the world to see yet because
      it's not ready to launch, you can hide your Ghost site behind a simple shared
      pass-phrase.

      You can toggle this preference on at the bottom of Ghost's General Settings



      Ghost will give you a short, randomly generated pass-phrase which you can share
      with anyone who needs access to the site while you're working on it. While this
      setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off
      to help keep the site off the radar.

      Do remember though, this is not  secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on
      this feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared
      pass-phrase for very basic privacy.
