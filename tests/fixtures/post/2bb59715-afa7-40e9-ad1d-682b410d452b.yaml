  Sometimes you might want to put your site behind closed doors

  If you've got a publication that you don't want the world to see yet because
  it's not ready to launch, you can hide your Ghost site behind a simple shared
  pass-phrase.

  You can toggle this preference on at the bottom of Ghost's General Settings



  Ghost will give you a short, randomly generated pass-phrase which you can share
  with anyone who needs access to the site while you're working on it. While this
  setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off
  to help keep the site off the radar.

  Do remember though, this is not  secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on
  this feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared
  pass-phrase for very basic privacy.
